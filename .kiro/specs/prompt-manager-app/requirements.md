# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a React Native/Expo iOS application that serves as a prompt management system for LLM chat applications. The app allows users to organize, store, and quickly access various types of prompts categorized by tasks, with support for both structured prompt templates and free-form text. The application includes a persistent widget feature for quick prompt access even when the main app is closed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and save prompts with different types (system, user, etc.), so that I can organize my LLM interactions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a new prompt THEN the system SHALL allow selection of prompt type (system prompt, user prompt, etc.)
2. WHEN the user saves a prompt THEN the system SHALL store the prompt content and metadata persistently
3. WHEN the user views saved prompts THEN the system SHALL display the prompt type clearly
4. IF the user attempts to save an empty prompt THEN the system SHALL display a validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to categorize prompts by tasks, so that I can quickly find relevant prompts for specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a prompt THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to a task category
2. WHEN the user views prompts THEN the system SHALL group prompts by their assigned categories
3. WHEN the user creates a new category THEN the system SHALL save it for future use
4. WHEN the user selects a category THEN the system SHALL display only prompts belonging to that category

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use predefined prompt templates for specific tasks, so that I can create consistent and effective prompts quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a new prompt THEN the system SHALL offer task-specific prompt templates
2. WHEN the user selects a template THEN the system SHALL populate the prompt creation form with the template structure
3. WHEN templates are provided THEN the system SHALL include placeholders for customizable content
4. WHEN the user modifies a template THEN the system SHALL allow saving the customized version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create free-form prompts without templates, so that I have flexibility for unique or experimental prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user chooses free-form creation THEN the system SHALL provide a blank text input field
2. WHEN the user types in free-form mode THEN the system SHALL support multi-line text input
3. WHEN the user saves a free-form prompt THEN the system SHALL store it with the same categorization options as templated prompts
4. WHEN the user switches between template and free-form modes THEN the system SHALL preserve any entered content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to copy prompts to my clipboard, so that I can easily paste them into LLM chat applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a saved prompt THEN the system SHALL provide a copy action
2. WHEN the user triggers the copy action THEN the system SHALL copy the prompt content to the device clipboard
3. WHEN the prompt is copied THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
4. WHEN the user copies a prompt THEN the system SHALL copy the complete prompt text without formatting artifacts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a prompt selection widget even when the main app is closed, so that I can quickly copy prompts without opening the full application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main app is closed THEN the system SHALL maintain a persistent widget on the device
2. WHEN the user interacts with the widget THEN the system SHALL display a list of available prompts
3. WHEN the user selects a prompt from the widget THEN the system SHALL copy it to the clipboard
4. WHEN the widget is displayed THEN the system SHALL show prompts organized by categories
5. IF the device resources are limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize widget functionality over other background processes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit and delete existing prompts, so that I can maintain and update my prompt library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects an existing prompt THEN the system SHALL provide edit and delete options
2. WHEN the user edits a prompt THEN the system SHALL preserve the original structure while allowing content changes
3. WHEN the user deletes a prompt THEN the system SHALL request confirmation before permanent removal
4. WHEN a prompt is modified THEN the system SHALL update the saved version immediately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work reliably on iOS devices, so that I can use it consistently across my Apple ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is installed on iOS THEN the system SHALL function on iOS 14.0 and later versions
2. WHEN the app runs on different iOS devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface appropriately
3. WHEN the app uses device features THEN the system SHALL request appropriate permissions
4. WHEN the app stores data THEN the system SHALL use iOS-compliant local storage mechanisms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want prompts to be stored locally on my smartphone device, so that I can always access them without internet connectivity and ensure data privacy and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompt data is saved THEN the system SHALL store it in the smartphone device's local storage
2. WHEN the app is used offline THEN the system SHALL provide full access to all saved prompts
3. WHEN prompt data is saved THEN the system SHALL NOT transmit data to external servers or cloud services
4. IF device storage capacity is insufficient THEN the system SHALL display warnings to the user and provide appropriate storage management options
5. WHEN the app is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL notify the user that all local prompt data will be deleted

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to develop and test the application using ExpoGo, so that I can ensure an efficient development cycle and debugging environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is developed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with ExpoGo execution
2. WHEN the application under development runs on ExpoGo THEN the system SHALL provide all basic functionality (prompt management, category management, clipboard integration)
3. WHEN tested on ExpoGo THEN the system SHALL properly operate local storage functionality
4. IF iOS widget functionality is required THEN the system SHALL clearly notify developers that native builds are necessary
5. IF there are limitations with ExpoGo THEN the system SHALL provide alternative methods or workarounds

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure and customize a persistently displayable widget even when the app is closed, so that I can build a prompt access environment optimized for my usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses widget settings THEN the system SHALL provide widget size selection options (small, medium, large)
2. WHEN the user configures widget display content THEN the system SHALL allow selection of categories and number of prompts to display
3. WHEN the user customizes widget layout THEN the system SHALL provide priority display settings for frequently used prompts
4. WHEN the user selects a prompt from the widget THEN the system SHALL immediately copy the selected prompt to the device clipboard
5. WHEN the widget is displayed THEN the system SHALL reflect the latest prompt data even when the app is closed
6. WHEN the user changes widget settings THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect the changes in the widget display
7. EVEN when the device is in locked screen state THEN the system SHALL enable prompt access from the widget
